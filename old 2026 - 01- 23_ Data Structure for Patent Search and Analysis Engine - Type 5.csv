The mooring operation is completed safely, quickly, and positively by rapidly withdrawing seawater into the hull through all opening in the mooring recess so as to reduce the hydrostatic pressure acting on the top of the mooring element as the element comes into contact with the hull of the vessel. n e pressure reduction is sufficient to shift the mooring element and its anchoring system from a net negative to a net positive buoyancy condition at the keel depth of the vessel. the seawater may be withdrawn by a high capacity pump that is either specifically installed for this purpose or is part of a bow thruster system of a type commonly found on large vessels.",Jans korsgaard,318 نورث بوست روود بيوجرسى 8550 امريكا,,318 نورث بوست روود بيوجرسى 8550 امريكا,,,,,,,,,,

The tying guide is then moved to engage an adjacent piece of vertical rebar, and the horizontal piece is bent inward for securing thereto. As the armature boom is moved about the mast and progressively raised, further vertical and horizontal pieces of rebar can be brought into juxtaposition and secured, thus generating a non-planar grid of rebar and other desired rebar weaves crossing patterns. An impermeable layer is placed over the grid, and a hardening material is applied to form a rigid shell.

These functional groups present in particular in the resin-rich inner layer part forming the inner wall of the pipe are chemical reaction centres which react with a very wide range of compounds, such as, for example, water, inorganic and organic acids and oxidizing agents. Thus, when the polyester pipes are used in drinking water pipelines, the components dissolved out of the polyester resin by the chemical reaction of the water and the free hydroxyl groups may have an adverse effect on the quality of the drinking water. The invention relates to a process for the production of pipeline parts from polyester resin, which in turn have increased water resistance. The process according to the invention is distinguished by the fact that at least the polyester layer forming the inner surface of the pipe is treated with a medium containing at least one isocyanate. This treatment does in fact result in the formation of a matrix having polyurethane groups, which in turn impart to the plastics pipe not only the desired water resistance but also increased strength and impact strength.",Hobas Engineering AG,"Birsigstrasse 2, 4054 Basel/ Switzerland","Birsigstrasse 2, 4054 Basel/ Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,

The ship trails one or more seismic sources and receivers and moves forward at a known velocity. The seismic sources emit seismic waves that travel through the water and reflect off interfaces between rock formations below the ocean floor. The motion of the sources and receivers introduces distortion in the recorded seismic data that can be modeled using Doppler theory The data preferably is corrected for source motion independently from the correction for receiver motion. The seismic data is first corrected for receiver motion and then for source motion. The technique for correcting for source motion includes correlating the receiver-corrected data with a reference sweep signal, performing an F-K transform, performing an inverse F-K transform on a selected subset of the F-K transformed data, and computing appropriate correction filters for the data resulting from the inverse F-K transform. This process is repeated for all subsets of F-K transformed data and the resulting filtered data are summed together.",MOBIL OIL CORPORATION,"5 Gallows Road, Fairfax, Virginia 22037, U.S.A.","5 Gallows Road, Fairfax, Virginia 22037, U.S.A.",,,,,,,,,,,

Auxiliary systems are kept to a minimum for lubrication, control, operation and start-up functions, thereby making the turbine particularly attractive for light aircraft. The combustion chamber is designed with deflectors (29) generating vortices in a secondary gas flow into the combustion chamber, thereby confining the flame front from penetrating into the cold region (3) of the chamber under variable operating conditions, simplifying cooling of the chamber walls. The highhspeed shaft is cantilever mounted on a pair of bearings (9A-9B) in the cold region and is provided with a longitudinal duct and an array of fine orifices (18) in the wall of the shaft which direct pressurized oil in the duct in the form of jets which impinge on the bearings with little relative speed, thereby increasing wetting of the bearing components. Oil is supplied to the duct by means of a positive-displacement pump (25) directly driven by the shaft. The output pressure of the pump provides a signal which is indicative of turbine speed and hence used to control the turbine start-up sequence. The turbine further includes devices for deecoupling vibrations between the three systems thereof, including a loosely mounted spline (16) coupling the high-speed shaft to the step-down system and disk dampening means (32) coupling the step-down system to the low-speed output shaft.",Gustavo Francisco Labala,"sixto fernandez 1005, B1832JGS, Lomas de Zamora, Pcia.de Buenose,Republic Argentin.","sixto fernandez 1005, B1832JGS, Lomas de Zamora, Pcia.de Buenose,Republic Argentin.",,,,,,,,,,,

Large heat pipes (Fig.3) immersed into huge body of water are used to absorb heat from the surrounding a1r and release it into the water. The resulting temperature differences enhance the created pressure gradient between the land and water, which in turn accelerates the air movement (wind) from high to low pressure and therefore enhances the onshore breeze. Weather changes in a certain coastal area would have a positive reflection on its vicinity and to certain extent to the climate change and storm prevention. A certain number of large heat pipes can be immersed into water body. The evaporator section (1) is exposed to the surrounding ambient, while the condenser section (5) is immersed in the water. The evaporator section will be heated up by the effect of high surrounding temperature. This heat will be dissipated through the condenser section to the sea/river by the heat pipe process. As a result, the surrounding ambient temperature will be lessened and a higher pressure cooler air in the vicinity of the heat pips will be created. This high pressure air will strengthen the sea-breeze.",Asaad Matar Youssef Abu-Zour,ABU DHABI P.O.BOX 8735 U.A.E,ABU DHABI P.O.BOX 8735 U.A.E,,abuzourasaad@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,,

The height of an evaporative cooling tower is usually limited by practical considerations such as structural strength, expense or architectural form. Wet bulb temperature is an important factor in performance of evaporative water cooling equipment, because it is the lowest temperature to which water can be cooled. This work investigates a new design of cooling tower, which independent of ambient condition or geographical location. The main principle is based on using one of the open-to-sky OTS shafts of multi-story building/s as a Body of the cooling tower and exploiting the exhausted cold foul air of the air-conditioned spaces as part of the induced draft air and as a condenser of the evaporation losses. To lessen/eliminate the high required demand power in pumping the hot water to higher elevation, an adequate vertical axis turbine is installed on the top of the cooling tower through ductwork as a source power. The proposed design concentrates on lowering the construction and operating costs, Lessening the makeup water and maximizing the heat load capacity, particularly in hot humid climate.

They can be manufactured in several ways and in accordance with different international specifications to suite each application. For underground pipe networks however, there are two methods of installation: a) Open-cut installation in which a trench is dug in the ground and the pipes laid out and connected together in the trench, and b) Micro tunneling in which the pipes are fed and continuously pushed (Jacked: hence called jacking pipes) behind a micro-tunneling/boring machine from one point to the other. Method a) is typically used for shallow networks in soft soil conditions while method b) is applicable to deep lines and in rock soils. The most widely used jacking pipes in the world are the reinforced concrete pipes (lined or unlined), other types of jacking pipes used are carbon steel and GRP pipes. For sewer lines in general however, it is important for the used pipe to have essential properties: 1) The inside surface of the pipe shall be smooth to facilitate the flow of sewer effluents, 2) the pipe shall be able to resist the chemically severe conditions resulting from the chemicals in the effluents, its temperature, and humidity, 3) Sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure forces resulting from the surrounding soil, and 4) economically competitive. Reinforced concrete only pipes can fulfill points (3) and (4) above, while GRP fulfills points (1) and (2). It is possible to manufacture GRP pipes that can fulfill points (1), (2), and (3) above and work as a jacking pipe, but then it will have to be too thick and therefore very expensive. Therefore, these new pipes (GRP pipes Encased in Reinforced Concrete) were invented to meet all the requirements of Jacking pipes).",Mohammed Abdullah Al- Refaey,"P.O.

In this context, long cloths could take many forms; like evening dresses, or traditional dresses of many parts of the world; like Arabian World, Japan, and some parts of Africa. For illustration purposes, the Arabian kandora will be used as a reference. Kandora is the name used in United Arab of Emirates for the Arabian dress of men. However, it is called differently from an Arabian country to another; like, Thoub in Saudi Arabia, Dishdasha in Kuwait, Gallibaya in Egypt, and Djellaba in Morocco. Although it has many names and few differences, the kandora is distinguished by its loose length that reaches ankles. Such length means that transporting it via private vehicle from the laundry to the house will often results in crumpling it. Usually, after laundering, the kandora gets hung by a regular hanger then put into a plastic bag. To be transformed via private vehicle, the hanger will be fixed to the grab handles in the backseats area. Where the upper half of Kandora will be hung, the lower part of the kandora will be left laying on the backseats. Because of the softness of the plastic bag and the movements of the vehicle, the lower half of the kandora often ends up fallen at the feet area and gets crumpled. As a solution, Double Hanger adds an extra hanging trait to the regular hanger and enables it to lift the whole kandora smoothly.",Ahmed Abdulkhaleq Ali Al Dhufri,Dubai  P.O.

The inspection can be realized without direct human intervention upon the inspected object, thus eliminating time wasting activities like physical control, unsealing, etc. The proposed method for nonintrusive inspection of vehicles and containers has a high inspection capacity (up to 200 vehicles per hour), by achieving a complete vehicle radiography (except the driver’s cabin), while driving through the scanning portal and building a system that implements this method, said system being geometrically optimized so that it can be transported rapidly in ISO standardized containers using conventional transport systems (airplane, ship, train, or terrestrial on public roads) in areas where a high level of security is mandatory. The system which implements the method presented earlier is constituted from a mobile scanning unit installed on a chassis 1, said chassis provided with a boom 3 that displays areas of detectors 10 specifically chosen according to the type of penetrant radiation used. In transport mode, the boom 3 is folded which assures the minimum gauge that would allow the compliance of the vehicle with the authorized dimensions of public road transport or in fitting the system into an ISO high cube standardized container. In scanning mode, the boom extends and takes an upside down “U” shape, sustaining at its inferior end, parallel with the detectors area 10 plan, the penetrant radiation source 9. The scanning system also includes a mobile control center which is positioned outside the exclusion area a and has the role to remotely command all the processes involved in the nonintrusive inspection.

Humanity has used the force of gravity for a long time in water and air driven turbines for electricity production. But in those technologies, the force used, is the one created by the gravitational field in the particular element, and once this element gives away its energy, it continues its movement and cannot be used in the same turbine again. In the gravity driven generator for sustainable movement (GDGSM), in order to create rotation force we use the fact that elements with different atomic weight, are subjected to different forces, while, exposed to gravity field. In the gravity driven generator for unsustainable movement (GDGSM) we use the difference in the force created between air (gas) and the liquid element to create a buoyant force, which through the solid element to be able to perform work. This is the main difference between the 2 types of technology as mentioned above. In conventional technology we have 1 element which gives its energy, and it the gravity driven generator for sustainable movement (GDGSM) we have 3 elements interacting, creating buoyant force which than perform work.",Mr. Valentine Trifonov Mihalkov,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",,,,,,,,,,,

However, this invented technology provides a much more sophisticated and interconnected device to achieve different objectives through several functionalities as illustrated below. - The device integrated with the smart home protocol - Has an interface with the smart phone application - Has an intelligent display outside the bath with new communication protocols - Linked with user profiles which would be used to measure the consumption for each individual - Enhance the awareness of each profile to change the consumption culture - Contains dashboard for high level consumption monitoring - Provides more safe architecture for the entire system using a wireless architecture with the overall system components - The sensors, pumps, PLCs, etc are all newly developed in an innovative system. As an alignment with the national and international strategies represented with the water distribution authorities’ visions and missions to provide a continuous saving consumption awareness for all types of water consumers. On the other hand, statically a 25% of the bath water consumption versus the total water consumption in each customer water supply invoice. This invention oriented to save/reduce the consumption of those 25% by inventing several techniques and functions. We invented an idea to save the un-suitable water because of undesired water temperature. Normally each person will waist the water before commencing the shower until the water temperature becomes to his body desired temperature, based on conducted study, varies from 5-7 liters per single shower use. The same concept covers also all types of sinks inside the bathrooms or kitchen. The invention outcomes showing that the total saving close to 15% of the total water consumption as an initial phase “Interconnected Shower system” which can be also implemented on all types of water supply inside and outside the buildings (Residential, commercial, governmental, industrials, public facilities etc..), which obviously would maximize the benefits and increases saving the overall water consumption.",Mahmoud Fawzi Abdullah Al-Hader,Al Ain,Al Ain,,Mahmoud.alhader@aadc.ae,37091438,+97137091438,,,,,,,

Groynes are widely used to protect the coastline against erosion caused by littoral drift. Traditionally, groynes are constructed using rocks, but other materials like timber, steel and concrete are also used. Compared to the rock groynes, the timber groynes are preferred due to its aesthetic and natural appearance, less footprint and thus less disturbance to the coastal processes and environment. However, till date the use of timber logs in groyne construction is limited to shallow depths due to the non-availability of longer lengths of logs with uniform cross-section. This led to the current concept of composite groynes, where the timber logs are fixed to continuously driven steel tubular piles. The timber logs are plugged through the fresh concrete, partially filled inside steel piles and the gap between the successive timber logs is filled with concrete to form an impermeable groyne. For aesthetic reasons, the top of steel piles has been fixed lower than the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT), in this case 0.5m below LAT, so that the steel piles are not visible at all tidal conditions. As the steel tubular piles can be fabricated to any desired length, the proposed composite groynes are applicable for any given water depth.",Dubai Municipality,Dubai-Deira-Banyi Yass Street-Dubai Municipality HO building # 20,Dubai-Deira-Banyi Yass Street-Dubai Municipality HO building # 20,,,,,,,,,,,

C Passive Pressure Passive Power Water Coller Problem: HOT WATER from the shower during SUMMER in the UAE & the Gulf Some cooling units and equipment have been made and are available in the market BUT they are: 1. Heat pumps 2. Normal air-condition units and they are expensive, power consuming and need a lot of maintenance Idea: Develop an apparatus and/or heat exchanger to cool water from the evaporation of water in the tank and further cool the tank water from the surrounding without consuming power. Solution: By using the house internal environment as a media (since UAE houses are centrally cooled) and the evaporation of the water from the tank, this concept can provide cool water for showers and washing usage, which eliminates the discomfort and the trouble users go through when taking showers in the hot summer. Further the evaporation of the water in the tank or container helps the water cool. Testing: 3 years of research and investigation in order to produce a unit that solves the hot water issue and develop a mechanism that can be long lasting that requires no additional power and low maintenance. After many meetings with our research team and engineering team, the idea of this particular equipment has been set forward. However, further refinement and development was required to make the mechanism as efficient as possible. Four units have already been built and put for testing. Testing the efficiency, the durability, and usage, this in the end has given justice to the years of research as the mechanism and concept was found satisfactory and useful for the required purpose. Bring comfort to your household, without facing any water temperature obstacles. History: Before the era of electricity and normal water supply in UA, we used to store water in a large clay pots that can carry 20-160L. The water in those pots was colder thru the environment or ambient temperature. This condition is due to the evaporation of water around the body of the pot. Such phenomenon can be used or I have used to cool water in APC tank. ALTERNATIVE POWER COOLER Concept  The idea has been developed to solve the big problems households has in the UAE and other Gulf countries in hot season when taking sower or bath.  Sustainable cold water solution with an apparatus that need no power. PASSIVE WATER COOLING APPARATUS  The water cooling apparatus will be of 1.5 or 2 mm galvanized mild steel tank or plastic container. The size will accommodate about 60 liter of water.  Inside the tank there will be a copper coil 1/2 inch pipe with a length of at least 50 ft.  The tank size would be at least 30 cm with a length not less than 100 mm or the length of the galvanized sheet. (40-60L water tank was enough)  Water ball will be connected at one end of the flow pipe better at out flow side to replace evaporated water. This might help prolong the water ball life.  The tank will need to be earthed, at any part, to reduce any galvanic current although there is no electric current Legend: 1.

The other part is internal and contains the evaporator, fan , and blower to push the cold air towards the cooling area. Through this new invention, we provide friendly environment air conditioning units that reduce the heat emission resulting from The outer section of the conventional air conditioning units, this is to reduce the greenhouse effect, which in turn has a positive reflection on the environment. The new air conditioning unit is considered as a single unit that is installed or fixed in the place where it is to be cooled. We have removed the outer section which is usually placed outside like the street or outside yard and this part usually has a high source of heat and we have merged it in the same internal unit by building a new body for the new unit, The first part of the air conditioner has a compressor, a fan and / or to cool the condenser or hot coil, the second or internal section of the air conditioner has an inflator or fan directed towards the evaporator to push the cold air towards the place where to be cooled. This is can be controlled by special control unit that has special keys or by remote control to increase or decrease the cooling degrees. Thus, the new air conditioning unit considered as one unit of the new air conditioner issued that has self-cooling mechanism to the hot air that generated by the hot coil which is located in the air conditioning unit, this happened by by passing the air as shown in Figure (7) so that the hot air gets out of the inflator to enter the tube inside the conditioning unit, and then enter it to the cooling unit to cool it in different ways as shown in the cases described in the general description, short description and protection elements. In this invention five methods have been used to cool the Condenser or Hot Coil and to cool its high heat, and reduce or prevent the heat as required to be acceptable. This is done by adding Heat Exchanger and Condenser as the new dryer machines mechanism. Or by immersing the Condenser or Hot Coil in a sealed box which has liquid, such as 3M Novec Engineering Fluid or any liquid that has the same function. The characteristics of this liquid enable to cool the high heat caused by electronics while running. Or we cool the Heat Exchanger and Condenser which exist in the dryer machine by making the parts that enter the Heat Exchanger and Condenser inside the liquid Novec Engineering Fluid to cool the parts that touch it from the exchanger and condenser and to cool the hot air coming from the Hot Coil. In this way we can reduce the heat that produced from the new air conditioning units emitted from the Hot Coil. Or we can cool the Heat Exchanger and Condenser in any way of cooling system, for example using Thermoelectric Peltier refrigeration Or we can put a small cooling unit, its function is to push the cold through the blower to the heat source on Condenser or Hot Coil Of the air conditioner that belongs to the air conditioning of the place to be cooled, and the body of the condenser and the composter that cools the Hot Coil is immersed in a container that contains the liquid Novec Engineering Fluid or any substance that has the same function of work.",Mousa Eisa Mousa Al Amri,303 Al Reem Tower,303 Al Reem Tower,,malamri@amricon.com,42292944,+97142292944,,,,,,,

These classification is the first step in identification and characterization of bacterial species isolated from environment or from clinical samples. Although, many commercially available media are viable, there is a continuous effort to develop better selective media to bacteria that cannot be grown on existing media. While exploring antibacterial property of a plant products, we observed that it has the potential to selectively inhibit growth of certain types of bacteria. This lead us to do the experiments which resulted in developing this media which selectively allowed the growth of only Gram negative bacteria. Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) was used as the base media and was modified to develop MHA-X (MHA containing the plant product, which we designate as plant-X). Water extract of 25 % (W / V) plant X material was used and added to the MHA to prepare the new media which was designated as MHA-X25. Number of strains of several medically important major Gram negative pathogens were tested; which included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and observed that all these bacterial species grew on MHA-X25. However, none of the major types of Gram positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus spp. and Enterococcus spp. grew on MHA-X25. Taken together, these findings show that MHA-X25 is a newly developed selective media for culture of Gram negative bacteria.",RAK Medical and Health Sciences University,"Al Juwais, Al Qusaidat, RAK","Al Juwais, Al Qusaidat, RAK",,ashfaque@rakmhsu.ac.ae,97172043251,+97172043251,,,,,,,

The innovation lies in the fact that data collection of plastic x-ray images was collected in a systematic and scientific way, not by randomly screening the baggage that contain the threat as it is in the scientific papers. This was as follows: i. Collecting x-ray images of the plastic threat being alone in the baggage without any other material so that the algorithm starts to learn the features of the gun without any noises from external objects. ii. Then collecting additional images of x-rays, but this time we add some organic materials in addition with the plastic threat (orange colors in x-ray) to mimic the colors of the plastic threat. This way the algorithm will start to note the difference in terms of shape too and it will no longer get fooled from the organic materials. iii. Finally, collection of baggage x-ray images that mimic that baggage of a normal passenger. That means the baggage must include both metallic and non-metallic materials, complex mixtures were made in addition to the plastic threat being hidden in the bag so that the algorithm generalize its knowledge to real life scenarios. 2- Innovation in Threat Image Projection technique: to create new synthetic images from original images that appear authentic to increase the dataset: a. There are other approaches for threat image projection, which is the projection of a threat from one image to another normal image to multiply the number of threat images, however some of these techniques are not very accurate. This means that new image will have cues that appear to be fake and that can be dangerous to the algorithm. b. The technique of (Solving Poisson equations with a predefined boundary condition) is an accurate technique as I have seen and makes the x-ray projection to be authentic. Again, this technique is used for other domains such as in nature, but I have tried it on x-ray threat images, and it worked greatly. 3- Innovation in the used of an already publicly available deep learning network by fine tuning its settings: a. A pretrained network was used (Googlenet) that is already available b. Speed and duration of learning the algorithm was adjusted to allow the network to learn the features of the hard to detect plastic threats (0.001 and 120 respectively) c. The augmentation settings of the algorithm are important to overcome overfitting however, the Scaling, zooming, and intensity augmentation of the images was disabled since it was experimented that is negatively affect the accuracy. Moreover, augmentations such as reflections and rotations were allowed in order to overcome overfitting problems. function protection in school buses to avoid forgetting children, The device is a buzzer that alerts and issues alarms The process of operation of this device in the case of the closure of the bus engine is running Motion Sensor system is the process of reading the movement in the case of extinguishing the engine and leave the driver without making sure the bus is free of children in any case in the event that the child Sleeping as soon as the movement of the child even a simple movement gives the device a loud alarm so that it draws the attention of any person near the bus while forgetting any child in the bus in addition to the process of communication and automatically the bus driver or the person in charge or the operating room and through this contact is to know the location of the bus via a Smart map..",Dubai Police General Head Quarters,Deira,Deira,,salyassi@dubaipolice.gov.ae,46099263,+97146099263,,,,,,,

Given its high nutritional value for humans, the need to design a mechanism for its introduction into the global food chain and its mass industrial production is strongly felt. Granulated date kernel herbal tea is a product that has managed to introduce a way to public use and mass production. This herbal tea is consumed like tea and only requires boiling water and 3-4 minutes of brewing. In this method, the hard and solid date kernel (roasted or not-roasted) is powdered to allow liquor extraction of all kernel particles in boiling water. However, transforming the kernel into powder is not sufficient to make it consumable. Due to the particles' dispersion and molecular weight, the powder stays afloat in water and its extracted liquor will contain solid particles, which accordingly causes non-transparency and poor quality of the extracted liquor. By adding a sedimentation (or translucent) agent to the kernel powder, the extracted liquor becomes clear and transparent. Shaping and granulizing of the powder will be possible by adding a natural binding agent. Moreover, with the addition of natural edible colors to this blend, a transparent extract of various colors could be obtained, though its original color may vary from light yellow to dark yellow. After mixing the above ingredients and converting the powder into paste by adding water, the processes of shaping and changing the paste into granular particles and drying are then executed.
